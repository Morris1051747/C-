# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

### Question:


Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
#### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```
#### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```
#### Constraints:
* `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
* `s `consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
