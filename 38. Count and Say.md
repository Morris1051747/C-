# 38. Count and Say


### Question:

The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

* `countAndSay(1) = "1"`
* `countAndSay(n)` is the way you would "say" the digit string from countAndSay(n-1), which is then converted into a different digit string.
To determine how you "say" a digit string, split it into the **minimal** number of groups so that each group is a contiguous section all of the **same character**. Then for each group, say the number of characters, then say the character. To convert the saying into a digit string, replace the counts with a number and concatenate every saying.

For example, the saying and conversion for digit string "3322251":

Given a positive integer `n`, return the ![equation](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=n%5Ex&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=) term of the count-and-say sequence.
#### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 1
Output: "1"
Explanation: This is the base case.
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 4
Output: "1211"
Explanation:
countAndSay(1) = "1"
countAndSay(2) = say "1" = one 1 = "11"
countAndSay(3) = say "11" = two 1's = "21"
countAndSay(4) = say "21" = one 2 + one 1 = "12" + "11" = "1211"
```

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= n <= 30`

```
public class Solution {
    public string CountAndSay(int n) {
            string output = "";          
            for (int i = 1; i <= n ; i++)
            {
                if(i == 1)
                {
                    output = "1";
                }
                else
                {
                    var characters = output.ToCharArray();
                    output = "";
                    
                    for (int j = 0; j < characters.Length; j++)
                    {
                        int count = 1;
                        while(j < characters.Length -1 && characters[j] == characters[j + 1])
                        {
                            count++;
                            j++;
                        }
                        output += count.ToString();
                        output += characters[j];
                    }
                }
            }
            return output;
    }
}
