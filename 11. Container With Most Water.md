# 11. Container With Most Water

### Question:

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ![equation](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=i%5Ex&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=) line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.
#### Example 1:
![Picture not found](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/17/question_11.jpg)
```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. 
In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

#### Constraints:
* `n == height.length`
* `2 <= n <= 105`
* `0 <= height[i] <= 104`

### Answer:
#### C sharp
```
public class Solution {
    public int MaxArea(int[] height) {
            int length = height.Length;
            int left = 0;
            int right = length - 1;
            int max = 0;

            while (left < right)
            {
                max = Math.Max(max, Math.Min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left));
                if (height[left] < height[right])
                    left++;
                else
                    right--;
            }
            return max;
    }
}
```
