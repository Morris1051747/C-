# 11. Container With Most Water

### Question:

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ![equation](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=i%5Ex&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=) line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.
#### Example 1:
```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

#### Constraints:
* `n == height.length`
* `2 <= n <= 105`
* `0 <= height[i] <= 104`

```
public class Solution {
    public int[] TwoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Dictionary<int, int> temp = new Dictionary<int, int>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.Length; i++)
        {
            int left = target - nums[i];
            if (temp.ContainsKey(left))
            {
                return new int[] { temp[left], i  };
            }
            if (!temp.ContainsKey(nums[i]))
            {
                temp.Add(nums[i], i);
            }
        }
        return null;        
    }
}
```
